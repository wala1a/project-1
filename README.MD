#Tic tac toe

The game itself is quite simple. But the concept of programming it is not. The computer must recognize the moves of the player and act accordingly to player’s strategy . This is quite complicated and actually not needed to finish this assignment.

All I have to create is a simple game that will allow my users to check the which figure they want to be playing.

#how to get started
To make a move, the player will use the mouse single click to mark a space. In this version, there is no provision to undo the move. As soon as the move is done, the game proceeds to the next player’s chance.
When the game ends, it displays one of the following three outcomes:
Winner: X
Winner: O
No one win!
